# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

Emily Maruska: For steps 12.3 everything went smoothly, I didnâ€™t have
any trouble getting the rmd file to load from github. For steps 12.4 I
did not check the add to md file so I only updated the rmd but not the
md, which was a problem but it was easily fixed.

Aidan Bobholz: Following along with step 12.3, I ran into one issue in
which I had to restart R in order for the git to register as installed
to create new project\>git thingy. After restarting R I was able to
successfully load in the git repository. Going into step four commiting
worked easliy, though for pushing I found out that you do not need to
select sign.

Ryan Ledbetter: For steps 12.3 everything went smoothly until I had to
deal with account issues. My account was setup with a personal account
and I had to make changes to my UAC settings in Windows but everything
is coolio.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.
